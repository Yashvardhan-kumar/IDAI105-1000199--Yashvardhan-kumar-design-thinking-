 Surveyed Group – Summary of Family & Friends Feedback

I shared the survey with 12 people including my close friends and family members (ages 14 to 35). Below is a summary of the feedback I collected through in-person conversations and digital responses:
🔹 Usage Patterns

    Most respondents (10 out of 12) reported using social media for 2–4 hours daily, especially in the evenings and late at night.

    The most commonly used apps were Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok.

🔹 Emotional Response

    8 respondents said they often feel guilty or tired after long scrolling sessions.

    5 said they sometimes feel anxious or numb, especially before sleeping.

🔹 Past Detox Attempts

    9 people had tried to take a break from social media at some point.

    Common struggles:

        “I deleted Instagram, but I reinstalled it in 2 days.”

        “It was hard because I got bored easily.”

        “My friends were still posting, and I didn’t want to feel left out.”

🔹 Motivators They Liked

    Everyone liked the idea of gentle reminders instead of full-on blocking.

    7 liked the idea of earning digital rewards (badges, coins, or stickers).

    6 wanted relaxation alternatives like reading or meditation ideas.

🔹 Preferred App Style

    Most people did not want a harsh blocker.

    They said they’d prefer:

        To track progress without shame

        To feel rewarded for doing well

        To see motivating quotes daily

🔹 Suggestions

Some suggestions from responses:

    “Let me earn coins for staying off apps — like a game.”

    “Remind me softly, not forcefully.”

    “Have a page that shows how much time I saved — that would feel good.”

 Conclusion

The insights gathered from this survey shaped the tone and features of the app. The prototype avoids aggressive restrictions and instead uses motivational design: positive quotes, soft detox goals, optional challenges, and relaxing alternatives. This aligns with how people said they wanted to reduce screen time — without guilt, with kindness.
