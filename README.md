Social Media Detox Tracker App – MindSpace Detox

Project Objective
This project aims to design a high-fidelity prototype for a Social Media Detox Tracker App using the Design Thinking methodology. The app is intended to support individuals in monitoring and reducing their social media usage by offering a judgment-free, motivational digital environment. The app combines habit-forming strategies with positive reinforcement, encouraging users to build healthier screen habits without feeling restricted.

Design Thinking Process

1. Empathize & Define
User research was conducted via surveys and informal interviews with individuals between the ages of 17 and 32. The objective was to understand behavioral patterns and emotional responses linked to daily social media use. Based on the responses, the following user concerns were identified:

    Users feel guilty or anxious after prolonged social media sessions.

    Many experience a fear of missing out (FOMO) when offline.

    Strict blocking tools are often disliked because they feel controlling or punitive.

    Users prefer systems that encourage change through subtlety and positive messaging.

These findings informed the empathy map and user personas. A key insight was the need for a solution that reduces screen time while making the user feel supported rather than judged.

Problem Statement:
How might we design a digital tool that helps users take control of their screen time in a way that is empowering, non-restrictive, and focused on personal growth?

2. Ideate
Following the Define phase, multiple ideation sessions were conducted using Miro to develop creative solutions that reflect user preferences. Features were selected based on their motivational value, usability, and alignment with behavior-change theories.

Core feature ideas included:

    A Progress Dashboard to track screen time and time saved.

    Daily Challenges (e.g., 7-day social media reduction goals).

    Motivational Rewards, such as stickers, relaxing sound packs, and digital badges.

    A Relaxation Hub that recommends alternatives to scrolling (e.g., journaling, meditation).

    A Mindful Quotes Feed to provide daily inspiration.

    A Detox Goal Setter with flexible limits and time restrictions.

These ideas were structured into logical user journeys and refined based on feasibility and user impact.

3. Prototype
The prototype was developed in Figma, emphasizing simplicity, accessibility, and visual encouragement. The color scheme uses soft greens and blues to create a calming atmosphere. Fonts are rounded and friendly, and icons and emojis are used to enhance emotional connection without clutter.

Ten screens were developed:

    Login and Welcome Screen

    Dashboard (with screen time overview, streak tracker, time saved)

    Set Detox Goal (with app selection, time limits, restriction hours)

    Challenges Page (7-Day Screen Time Slash challenge, no buttons)

    Rewards Overview (summary of earned badges and coins)

    Individual Reward Pages (Motivational Stickers, Sound Pack, Discipline Hero Badge)

    Relaxation Hub (visual suggestions like reading, breathing, and walking)

    Mindful Quotes Feed (scrollable inspirational quotes with mood filters)

    Detox Summary (ongoing progress, apps being avoided, benefits)

    Use Coins Page (passive view of redeemable rewards with cost and description)

Each screen was designed to function passively—users can scroll and view without needing to tap or interact unless they choose to.

4. Test
The prototype was shown to a small test group of users for feedback. Testing focused on usability, design clarity, and emotional response to the tone and content of the app. Feedback indicated that:

    The visual design felt supportive and non-judgmental, which aligned with the goal.

    Users appreciated having no required interaction; they could absorb motivation passively.

    Several testers noted that the Relaxation Hub and Mindful Quotes were their favorite features.

    The Detox Goal interface was clear, but adding icons and time summaries helped improve it further.

Minor revisions were made based on this feedback:

    Increased font contrast for clarity

    Slightly larger icons in the Rewards section

    More calming illustrations added to Relaxation Hub
